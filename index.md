## Welcome to my Page

I am a software engineer currently based in New Yorj. I have over 4 years of experience in Information Technology: Server and Network management and desktop engineering. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. I like listening to music, games, and travelling. My favorite game is most definitely Battlefield 4, for now at least.

You can browser me github profile here to see some of the work I've done.
Feel free to add me on LinkedIn and Twitter as well.
Thanks for passing by!
