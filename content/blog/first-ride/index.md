The title is _wildly_ misleading (teehee), this wasn't really my first time on the west coast. It's actually the third.
I first came to Las Vegas in the summer of 2018, for about a week. I luckily got to stay for free thanks to one of my good friends who had a month-long training there. 
Then, in November of 2018, I went to San Francisco, that trip ended up being more of a nature trip than a city one, even though I was in Silicon Valley. I did about a third of the highway one drive, a breathtakingly gorgeous scenery that I will most definitely do again. I also went all the way out to yosemite. I am definitely I did all that and less of San Fran because, well, I've found out, exploring cities isn't quite as glamorous as the outdoors. Something about seeing mountains and stretches of open land really helps to appreciate life more. A maybe that's just me. Regardless, I'd set a pretty good precedent of coming to west coast and enjoying the _coast_ in the west. My trip last trip there was to SoCal. Well, I started writing this while still on the trip so I might end up with a mix of "is" and "was". Just bare with me.

Here's the very first picture I took, after getting off the FlyAway bus that goes from LAX to Union Station.

Ok, not a great view, unfortunately, that's the awkward perspective I had to work with. 
This hardly represents what people think of when they go to LA, but I just wanted to know what life is like for regular LA people. What does it really mean, to live in LA. That's why I took the bus. Because, at the end of the day, one of the things we end up doing a majority of our life, outside of actual work, is commuting to work.
