So I'm taking yet, another stab at my blog. I really want to have a way or narating my travel experiences, and since I have dedicated to the no-Facebook lifestlye, I have very limited options left. Perhaps, this _is_ the only options considering the amount of freedom I wish to have. So here we are.
Which reminds me, I should have posts on _my_ experience living in 2020 without any (Facebook powered) social media.

But here we go, I'm building this on `gatsby` because, I have come to really appreciate writing UI, but particularly in `React`. I hope it doesn't end being so restrictive that I will have to migrate. I doubt it, at least to start. I mean, I don't even have a proper image hosting set up yet. I don't want to front load all the word and end up not releasing anything so this will go live. **WILL**.
And then we'll take it from there.
