I like *knowing* and *keeping* as much as I can about myself (but I *despise* someone/something else doing it behind my back). Partly because I'm pretty forgetful, partly because of the sentimental value of having that reference. When I was an avid Google maps user (Android), I used to *depend* on location ~~tracking~~ history. I would even use it to know what time I was arriving/leaving work for filling out time sheets. I've moved on from that. But I do miss knowing about how long I was at a place on a certain day without relying on my finicky memory. Unfortunately, nothing currently will give me that without using it for targeted-ads and, God knows what else. What I want is to have all that data with me in complete control and ownership over it.

## Track all the things.
This might sound counter-intuitive. Personally, I don't avoid tracking in and of itself. I love Journalling. And it's such a beneficial ritual for me that I would not give it up even if I had to use a tool/app that isn't "super secure". What scares me is what the tracked data is used for, both in the open (mostly ads) and behind closed doors (...feeding the MAN? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ). I wish there was an...open-standard? I don't know what it would be. But I want a way for me to *log* mundane activities and events in my life that's low effort to maintain, easy-to-control, and available only to me and possibly anyone else I **choose** to share it with.

> Scrobble: To publish one's music-listening habits to the Internet via software, in order to track when and how often certain songs are played. [Wiki](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scrobble)

I want scrobbling, for **everything**. Digital events (watching a movie/show, reading a book ...) and anything else I want. Unfortunately, currently, only LastFM offers a way to scrobble <sup>[1](#notes)</sup> (they coined the term); only music streams are supported; and it's always public. 

### Centralization: 
Scrobbling is not a catch-all for any service that lets your log your streams from your music player. It's sending your streams *to LastFM*. If Last FM changes anything about their service, or it goes out, there's no where else to go. So if scrobbling will ever be cool again, it has be an open/generalized concept. Something anyone can implement. For example, I must be able to scrobble (my Netflix watch history, Spotify streams etc) to one scrobbling service, and then later on, choose to migrate to a, maybe self-hosted version? - and it would all continue to work.

### Share it: 
I want this fictional scrobble service to allow users to choose *who* they want to share a particular scrobble with, if anyone. Right now, on LastFM, everything is public. Someone has to know your username to find you but besides that, there is not much of control. This is essentially a showstopper for an "everything scrobbler". Even *I* wouldn't share random activities in my life if it's going to become a permanent trail. I don't have a "how" it will be done.  Social media platforms give users this type of control to an extent. So it should be possible, maybe hard. But the primary goal of this scrobbler is to benefit the individual. If it's not possible to share at all, that's fine. There's still value to the user.

## But Why?

### Power to the people
Letting user's *own* their data, I think, might be a way to disrupt targeted ads. I don't hate ads. I appreciate the value of marketing. But there's just this thin (or maybe not so thin) line that when is crossed in an ad makes rather uneasy. *Creepy*. Those ads are usually more annoying than "influencing" me. I don't have control over *how* granular I want ads I see are. It's either random ads or targeted ads. It'll be much better if each person gets decide what part of their life is public and monetized and what they want to keep to themselves, for however long they want.

### Time Machine. 
This is a harder sell but it is my main motivation for this idea. I want to have a reference when someone asks me the last good movie I saw on Hulu and I can't, for the life of me, remember.
I mean, how cool would it be to have a stream of my activities like:
- started reading "Everything is F*cked" on Kindle on `<Date>` at `<Time>`
- listened to "Lo-Fi Beats" on Spotify at ...
- worked on blog post draft at ...
- Watched Paradise PD (~~don't~~ watch this show) on Netflix....

And I would have that stream auto-populated and visible to me. I could have "books read" set to auto share. This is pretty much like an automated journal. But, having it be a "standard" format everybody does it would be awesome. I can see friend's "music streams" regardless of their provider. Or books read, even if it's a ~~bootlegged~~ epub. I can get a summary of my month, year; life in review. Or of someone else's, if they've chosen to share

It’s hard to get people to willingly and *explicitly* volunteer what they eat, watch, listen to, where they go to, all be put together in …some tech-thing. Of course, with a good amount of trust built up, some people will. On the flip side, a lot of us are currently *implicitly* giving all this data away. If we could put together what the popular apps/services have on us - what I’ve listed here would be insignificant. So maybe, in a way: This is sorta kinda probable? One can dream. 



## Misc.
1) There are alternative stream scrobbling, like [wavy.fm](https://wavy.fm) with *less* functionality and mostly the same issues as LastFM. LastFM is **THE** scrobbling service.
