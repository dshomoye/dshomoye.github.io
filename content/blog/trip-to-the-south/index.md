## Heading south, down south.
This was a notable trip for me, I‚Äôd never gone any farther south than Virginia, which is where I live now. Of course, VA itself is in the south, the capital of it too, at some point. But I live close enough to Washington, D.C. that I don‚Äôt consider myself living in the south. I haven‚Äôt particularly yearned for an opportunity to travel down south mainly cause I prefer and I‚Äôm used to the more vibrant, busy, noisy (and quite frankly, straight-up crazy) life of new york. It reminds me of Lagos, Nigeria. The south, I‚Äôve always imagined is more calm, and the people are nice and welcoming. Some like that, and of course, I do want people to be nice. I just also like truth and honesty. So if I had to choose, I‚Äôd rather  have brutal honesty than nice words with no root. All of that aside, I was still excited to go on this trip for various reasons. I was going to drive there; I would be visiting **2** southern cities/states within a few days, both for the first time. I would be seeing a friend I haven‚Äôt seen in literally over a decade who now lives in Charlotte, and another dear friend (Mel from here on) who lives in Atlanta. Very exciting times. On the driving front, I chose this painful option because it required the least amount of planning time and money to complete.  I am a strong proponent of valuing time above a lot of things, but in this case, I erred on the side of devaluing my time because I wanted to do a *very long* drive as a first new experience. I‚Äôm setting so many records already, why not a longest drive record right? I could have planned better and gotten a more convenient travel situation but this entire trip was a spontaneous decision that came together days before the trip as I was transitioning between leaving my old position at Capital One to join Splunk (yay yay!) , more on that on a separate post.

###  Atlanta 
Unsurprisingly, driving to Atlanta was a rigurous endeavor. I‚Äôve never done such a long drive before, outside of another road trip I‚Äôd taken in 2018 from NYC to Niagara Falls. That was probably about 70% of the Atlanta trip (440 mi vs 640 mi).  
I ended up completing the trip in about eleven hours. I stopped only one time, for gas and food. Definitely optimized my time. Considering how tiring and tasking that was though, I'm not certain if I'm impressed for completing such a feat, or disappointed for putting myself though it. I mean at one point I just felt like I was cannonballing.** Cite 

Thankfully I arrived in ATL safe and sound. I was a little early for check-in at my Airbnb so I got dinner with Mel at this Asian/Mexican fusion restaurant called Takorea. I got a chicken ("sticky chicky") and a beef taco from there. Oh man were they good. Especially the marinated beef, it was, amazing. 
From there, I went to my Airbnb so I can finally rest my body after the ill-advised driving marathon I'd just finished. It's a very nice Airbnb. Definitely one of the nicest (if not *the* nicest) Airbnb I've been in. Particularly the building itself. Here's a look outside from my room.

And that was my first day. (Well, its more like first night, considering I spent the *whole* day on the road ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

#### Palisades Park
Although I technically spent 3-ish days in Atlanta, the core of everything I did was in a day, on my second day. Props to Mel for doing such a great job with the day's plan.
Our first stop was Palisades park. Well, I *found out* it was Palisades park. Mel was nice enough to keep things mysterious (and very much interesting for me). I‚Äôm a fan of hiking and since I hadn‚Äôt hiked a new trail in a long time. I was pretty excited. Of course, there‚Äôs also the fact that this is a completely new climate region so the environment is actually noticeably different. There were bamboo trees! I haven‚Äôt seen those since Nigeria.

Then, there was the **Chattahoochee** river.  We got a pretty good view of the river.

I find it hard to narrate the experience, it being a hike. But the sounds (or lack of it) was just so serene. It really sums up my affinity for hiking. A chance to escape the endless noise of time we live in. The calming sound of a flowing stream of water? Now, *that‚Äôs* therapy. It‚Äôs like having the *Calm* app, except its all around you, not on your phone (I should add, I think the phone is probably not the appropriate medium for such things but maybe I‚Äôll save that for another post).  It was a great experience. Now that I‚Äôve failed to convey what the feeling of being in the calm of nature brings, maybe these pictures below will do a better job. 
Oh, I also took pictures and got some footage with my new drone! It‚Äôs my second time flying it. And my first location was Burke Lake Park, VA. Here‚Äôs a picture I took with my wonderful guide, unintentionally obfuscated to protect *everyone‚Äôs* privacy. 
And here‚Äôs cut-down footage of the river from the drone.

### Krog Street Market & Beltline
Our next location was Krog Street Market, it's great, but most of what I remember is devouring a bowl of, actually really good Pho (Pho Nam).
It was pretty conveniently located close to the Eastside of the Beltline. Oh, there was a really cool Koi mural on the wall on the way to the market! Atlanta has a lot of really cool murals (and/or graffiti).  Along the Beltline we also saw some sculptures made from what appears to be parts of machines and other scrap metal. See for yourself below. Also, notable, was a random game house of sorts called Axis Replay (its basically a PC Bang) we found along the betline. It's such a cool concept and I'm glad ideas like this are making their way stateside. Building more of a community around E-sports. At this point, there's no arguing the validating of games as sports so, why not? I've seen a couple videos of Street Fighter tournaments on YouTube and the FGC ("fighting game community") just seems like a good group to be a part of. This seems like a good way of broadening it to all gamers. #gamersunite! üéÆ (I hope this isn't some underground gamergate tag )

Afterwards, we went to the Fourth Ward skate park, grab some chow a bar, New Realm. This bar had way more space than ~~it deserves~~ I'm used to seeing. From there we went to Ponce City Market. Apparently, the largest red brick structure in **all of the south east** A fact which even Mel, my tour guide was unaware of. It was a interesting market for sure. Also has some offices there. Notably GA (General Assembly) is located there. I'm not quite certain how they've gotten but GA was one of my go-to resources for learning development in my *early days*. Props to them.
