## Heading south, down south.
This was a notable trip for me, I’d never gone any farther south than Virginia, which is where I live now. Of course, VA itself is in the south, the capital of it too, at some point. But I live close enough to Washington, D.C. that I don’t consider myself living in the south. I haven’t particularly yearned for an opportunity to travel down south mainly cause I prefer and I’m used to the more vibrant, busy, noisy (and quite frankly, straight-up crazy) life of new york. It reminds me of Lagos, Nigeria. The south, I’ve always imagined is more calm, and the people are nice and welcoming. Some like that, and of course, I do want people to be nice. I just also like truth and honesty. So if I had to choose, I’d rather  have brutal honesty than nice words with no root. All of that aside, I was still excited to go on this trip for various reasons. I was going to drive there; I would be visiting **2** southern cities/states within a few days, both for the first time and I would be seeing a friend I haven’t seen in literally over a decade, at a much different time in my life, I should add. Very exciting event. On the driving front, I chose this painful option because it was required the last amount of planning time and money.  I am a strong proponent of valuing time above a lot of things, but in this case, I erred on the side of devaluing my time because I wanted to do a *very long* as a new experience. I’m setting so many records already, why not a longest drive record right? I could have planned better and gotten a more convenient travel situation but this entire trip was a spontaneous decision that came together days before the trip as I was transitioning between leaving my old position at Capital One to join Splunk (yay yay!) , more on that on a separate post.

###  Atlanta 
Driving to Atlanta was a rigurous endeavor. I’ve never done such a long drive before, outside of another road trip I’d taken in 2018 from NYC to Niagara Falls. That was probably about 70% of the Atlanta trip (440 mi vs 640 mi).  
I ended up completing the trip in about eleven hours. I stopped only one time, for gas and food. Definitely optimized my time. Considering how tiring and taking that was though, I'm not certain if I'm impressed for completing such a feator disappointed for putting myself though that. I mean at one point I adjust felt like I was cannonballing.** Cite 
Thankfully I arrived in ATL safe and sound. I was a little early for check-in at my Airbnb so I got dinner with my friend at this Asian/Mexican fusion restaurant called Takorea. I got a chicken ("sticky chicky") and a beef taco from there. Oh man were they good. Especially the marinated beef, it was, amazing. 
From there, I went to my Airbnb so I can finally rest my body after the unintended marathon I'd just partaken in. It's a very nice Airbnb. Definitely one of the nicest (if not *the* nicest) Airbnb I've been in. Particularly the building itself. Here's a look outside from my room. *** 
And that was my first day

#### Palisades Park
Although I technically spent 3 days in Atlanta, the core of everything I did was in a day, on my second day. 
Our first stop was Palisades park. Well, I *found out* it was Palisades park. My tour guide was nice enough to keep things mysterious (and very much interesting for me). I’m a fan of hiking and since I hadn’t hiked a new trail in a long time. I was pretty excited. Of course, there’s also the fact that this is a completely new climate region so the environment is actually noticeably different. There were bamboo trees! I haven’t seen those since Nigeria.

Then, there was the **Chattahoochee** river.  We got a pretty good view of the river.

I find it hard to narrate the experience, it being a hike. But the sounds (or lack of it) was just so serene. It really sums up my affinity for hiking. A chance to escape the endless noise of time we live in. The calming sound of a flowing stream of water? Now, *that’s* therapy. It’s like having the *Calm* app, except its all around you, not on your phone (I should add, I think the phone is probably not the appropriate medium for such things but maybe I’ll save that for another post).  It was a great experience. Now that I’ve failed to convey what the feeling of being in the calm of nature brings, maybe these pictures below will do a better job. 
Oh, I also took pictures and got some footage with my new drone! It’s my second time flying it. And my first location was Burke Lake Park, VA. Here’s a picture I took with my wonderful guide, unintentionally obfuscated to protect *everyone’s* privacy. 
And here’s cut-down footage of the river from the drone.
