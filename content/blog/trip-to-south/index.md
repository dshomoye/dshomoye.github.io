## Heading south, down south.
This was a notable trip for me, I’d never gone any farther south than Virginia, which is where I live now. Of course, VA itself is in the south, the capital of it too, at some point. But I live close enough to Washington, D.C. that I don’t consider myself living in the south. I haven’t particularly yearned for an opportunity to travel down south mainly cause I prefer and I’m used to the more vibrant, busy, noisy (and quite frankly, straight-up crazy) life of new york. It reminds me of Lagos, Nigeria. The south, I’ve always imagined is more calm, and the people are nice and welcoming. Some like that, and of course, I do want people to be nice. I just also like truth and honesty. So if I had to choose, I’d rather  have brutal honesty than nice words with no root. All of that aside, I was still excited to go on this trip for various reasons. I was going to drive there; I would be visiting **2** southern cities/states within a few days, both for the first time and I would be seeing a friend I haven’t seen in literally over a decade, at a much different time in my life, I should add. Very exciting event. On the driving front, I chose this painful option because it was required the last amount of planning time and money.  I am a strong proponent of valuing time above a lot of things, but in this case, I erred on the side of devaluing my time because I wanted to do a *very long* as a new experience. I’m setting so many records already, why not a longest drive record right? I could have planned better and gotten a more convenient travel situation but this entire trip was a spontaneous decision that came together days before the trip as I was transitioning between leaving my old position at Capital One to join Splunk (yay yay!) , more on that on a separate post.
