So I'm taking yet another stab at my blog. I really want to have a way or narrating my thoughts, experiences and anything that I find interesting enough to write about, and since I have dedicated to the no-Facebook life, I have very limited options left. Perhaps, this _is_ the only option considering the amount of freedom I wish to have. So here it is.
Which reminds me, I should have post(s) on _my_ experience living in 2020 without any (Facebook powered) social media. So lookout for that.

I'm building this on `gatsby` because, I have come to really appreciate writing UI, particularly in `React`. I hope it doesn't end up being so restrictive that I will have to migrate. I doubt it, at least to start. I mean, I don't even have a proper image hosting set up yet. I don't want to front load all the work and end up not releasing anything so this will go live. **WILL**.
And then we'll take it from there.
