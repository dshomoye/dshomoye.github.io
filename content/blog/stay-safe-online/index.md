> Just as I was about to publish this post, I saw [this article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/google-tracked-his-bike-ride-past-burglarized-home-made-him-n1151761) about a Florida man üôÉ who received an email from Google that the police had requested his information because he's a suspect in a crime case. All because Google was tracking his every single step. This is why everyone should care. This could be anyone. Who wants to have to deal with legal fees because their phone is **spying** on them and they happened to be jogging or running around a certain place.

I‚Äôve had the plan to write a post on all of the things listed here but never felt like it would be substantial. So I‚Äôve been waiting. But that could take forever so I‚Äôve decided to consolidate tiny posts into one.
As the title suggests, these are some guidelines I abide by to be a little _safer_ online. I wont say ‚Äústay protected‚Äù because none of the things here are a _guarantee_ but they will certainly reduce the probability of the negative. Some of these, notably the section on Facebook, are less of a technical defense than they are a mental and psychological one.

Here‚Äôs the TL;DR References and links will be in the actual paragraphs.

- [Use virtual credit card numbers](#virtual-card-numbers)
- [Delete Facebook](#delete-facebook) ‚Ä¶ ? ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- [Use a password manager](#password-manangers)
- [Set up Two-Factor authentication](#two-factor-authentication)
- [Use an encrypted messaging platform](#encrypted-messaging)
- [Use a privacy-focused browser](#web-browsers) (e.g. _not_ Chrome), or at least an ablocker.

### Virtual Card Numbers

This has been high on my list of things I wanted to write about. What really grinds my gears was my experience with AMC‚Äôs A-list subscription. I decided to cancel A-list and lo-and-behold. I _CAN'T_. Seriously, if you have A-list. Go and _try_ to cancel your membership. It‚Äôs not possible. Well, you won't be able to do it yourself. You have to contact their customer service. Which, besides the ridiculous time wasted, would involve some nonsense back-and-forth where the rep will try and convince you that you absolutely need to stay. I could be wrong. Maybe it only takes five minutes. But its ridiculous I have to contact _them_ to cancel _my_ account! It literally took me two minutes (probably less) to sign up for the subscription. If I had to contact customer service to sign up for an account, I _probably_ wouldn‚Äôt have. But they had to make it harder for me to leave. This, is a _Dark Pattern_. I briefly mentioned this in my [post](/no-social-media-no-life) about social media in society.

<media-box src="media/stay-safe-online/virtual_card.png" name="Totally unreal virtual cards" noBorder=true></media-box>

This is almost turning into a rant. The moral of the story is. I didn‚Äôt want to contact their customer service. If it was easy to join, it should be easy to leave. So I created a virtual credit card number on my Capital One Venture card, added it to my account, removed the old card, and disabled the new virtual number. I waited until billing time, at which time I got to laugh at the ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt process your payment‚Äù emails. My account got cancelled. And now I‚Äôm happy. This really isn‚Äôt the best argument for a virtual card number but it‚Äôs one of the good ones. It gives peace of mind. One of the better scenarios to be glad to have a virtual card, which coincidentally also happened to me: you order from an online store; make a payment with a virtual card number; the store gets [hacked](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21153434/slickwraps-apologizes-customers-bad-data-breach)‚ßâ. You disable the card. And live on like nothing happened. My two best recommendations for this are privacy.com (for any kind of card) and capitalone.com if you're willing to sign up for a card if you don't already have one. I believe Citi card also offers this I, so some research might be worthwhile.

### Delete Facebook.

### Password Managers

I hope everyone has at least _heard_ of password managers. It‚Äôs a huge undertaking to adopt them. And I‚Äôll admit to not really thinking about that when I advise people to start using a password manager. A password manager is basically an application that runs on your phone and computer. It allows you to store all your passwords in it. And whenever you need to log into a website or another application, it will surface the password and auto fill it for you. Sometimes the auto-fill isn't seamless, so you just copy the password, and paste it into wherever. Pretty simple.

<media-box src="media/stay-safe-online/password_managers.jpg" name="Password managers posing for a photoshoot"></media-box>

‚ÄúThis is isn‚Äôt better than my diary of passwords‚Äù you say. Well, you‚Äôre right. This is not the _right_ way to use a password manager. Also, if your diary gets stolen or lost, you‚Äôre fudged. Now, the right way to use a password manager is: after migrating all your existing (and probably bad) passwords, you _generate_ new passwords. A **unique** password for each website. And for every new, site, you get a unique password too. Now that‚Äôs security! This is where ‚ÄúI memorize my passwords‚Äù just doesn‚Äôt cut it. Also, you can‚Äôt really memorize that many passwords. Well I guess you could memorize ‚Äúpassowrd1‚Äù, ‚Äúpassword2‚Äù‚Ä¶ but , come on. We all know better than that. My recommendations: Lastpass (Free), 1Password (I use this), and Dashlane. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using just any password manager. These are your passwords after all.

### Two Factor Authentication

Having two-factor authentication (2FA) on an online account is just as important as having a good password. One common place 2FA is required is online banking. Most banks now require users to provide both a password **and** a code sent to the user's device before they can access their online account -- especially if its from a new computer or new location. This usually comes in the form of an SMS sent to the user's phone number. Having 2FA an accout means having a compromised password doesn't mean a compromoised account. SMS authentication is good and its still a strong recommendation if its the only avaialable option for an account. However, it's not the best method, as the [hack of Twitter's CEO shows](https://www.wired.com/story/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked/)‚ßâ. Fret not, there are other options including using a hardware token and a software token. Using a software token is more convenient option. Google authenticator is probably the most popular app for this but my recommendation (I use this for all my accounts) is [Authy](https://authy.com)‚ßâ. If you're curious which of your accounts support 2FA, there is actually [a website dedicated](https://twofactorauth.org/#backup)‚ßâ to providing that info as well as the options avaiable. So go forth and be secure!

### Encrypted Messaging

Encrypted messaging apps are not a particular necessity, unless you‚Äôve got a target on your head and someone important _really_ wants to know what you‚Äôre up to or you live in a surveillance state and just need some level of privacy and autonomy. However, out of principle, I think they‚Äôre important. Imagine having someone follow you around, recording everything you say to everyone, and uploading those recordings to their employers to listen to. This isn‚Äôt really a wild thought. If you use an app like Facebook messenger or Twitter/Instagram DMs, this is a pretty apt analogy. I‚Äôm sure most people wouldn‚Äôt be okay with having their voice conversations recorded but are somehow more okay with text. Even though we‚Äôre saying the same things!
<media-box src="media/stay-safe-online/messaging.gif" name="Blue Bubbles FTW!"></media-box>
So here are my recommendations: Signal, iMessage (if you have an iPhone) and, _reluctantly_ WhatsApp. These apps are the only ones that are backed by trustworthy organizations (Signal) or verified technology (iMessage, WhatsApp). Although Telegram is more secure than pretty much every other messaging app, I‚Äôd still choose from the top 3 first.

### Web Browsers

I think of web browsers as the cars we use to drive through the roads of the internet. Some are very bare-bones and some are decked out. But at the end of the day, you just want to enter a (web) address and want your browser to go there. Like cars, its important your browser is helping you navigate online _safely_. I strongly discourage against using Google Chrome as a daily driver because of all the tracking Google does -- it‚Äôs a lot of tracking.
My all around preference is Firefox, Mozilla, the company behind Firefox has made a lot of effort into positioning themselves as suppporters of freedom and openness on the internet. I currently use Brave, its very similar to Chrome (based on it even) but it primarily exists as an antithesis to all of Chrome‚Äôs attack on user privacy. The founder of Brave (Brendan Eich) is also a very fascinating character, he created JavaScript, the language that powers pretty much all websites and some mobile sites. He was actually at a point the CEO of Mozilla. So here are my recommendations: Firefox, Brave; in that order.
<media-box src="media/stay-safe-online/brave_browser.gif" name="Bravely choose Brave" noborder="true"></media-box>

If you _really_ have to use Chrome, (and you don‚Äôt) Brave is more or less a drop in replacement. But if you do, you have to have have [uBlock origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)‚ßâ installed. This is actually available for Firefox and Brave as well. I want to recommend Safari. I really do. But Apple has basically killed extensions in Safari so no way to properly block ads. And ads can be bad. Like, infect-your-computer-with-a-virus bad.

### Tidbits

- When setting up a Windows computer, don‚Äôt connect to internet until everything is set up. If you do, Microsoft will force you to sign in with a Microsoft account before you can use your computer.
- [Fakespot](fakespot.com)‚ßâ for amazon reviews. Yes, a lot of "five-star" reviews are fake.
- Get a virtual phone number. This is slightly similar to the virtual card numbers. It‚Äôs important because phone numbers are a critical identification method. Your phone number is tied to critical information like address and birthday. Tied together makes identity theft easier. Google voice is a great free service for this. There‚Äôs a resounding irony of me bashing google and recommending them at the same time but it‚Äôs really hard to beat Google voice. And at the end of the day. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs most important. Choosing what‚Äôs best - for you.
