I say ”functional” because JavaScript is not a functional language. It does not enforce functional paradigms. These guarantees, I think is the real draw to writing in a functional language. If your code compiles, it’s not only syntactically correct - something you’d get from almost any compiled language, it’s also algebraically sound: the code won’t run into…]]></description><link>https://www.dshomoye.dev/here-be-functions/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.dshomoye.dev/here-be-functions/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Apr 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Scrobble Everything.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I like knowing and keeping as much as I can about myself (but I despise someone/something else doing it behind my back). Partly because I’m pretty forgetful, partly because of the sentimental value of having that reference. When I was an avid Google maps user (Android), I used to depend on location tracking history. I would even use it to know what time I was arriving/leaving work for filling out time sheets. I’ve moved on from that. But I do miss knowing about how long I was at a place on a…]]></description><link>https://www.dshomoye.dev/scrobble-everything/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.dshomoye.dev/scrobble-everything/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Mar 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bootstrapping a simple Mac app can be hard.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I was consolidating my notes (Bear) and journal (Day One) into Bear. Day One has an “On This Day” and a Calendar view for looking back while Bear doesn’t. I figured I could make a simple app that would: Show Bear notes that were created on today’s date from previous years. I wouldn’t need a custom tool but queries like x OR y OR z aren’t possible in Bear, yet. But I can make multiple queries and combine them (x + y + z) outside Bear;  Bear provides a bunch of callbacks, including one for search…]]></description><link>https://www.dshomoye.dev/simple-mac-app/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.dshomoye.dev/simple-mac-app/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[You may not need React]]></title><description><![CDATA[I think React is currently the default UI library for web development. And for good reason. It’s relatively high-performance and easy to learn, and more importantly, has a large ecosystem around it. Just about anything you want to create, there’s a good chance someone’s made it, and has it available as a package. But React is not perfect and not always the right choice. This is an exploration of libraries I’ve used and I consider to be, in certain cases, better alternatives. Going React…less?

It can only be done by downloading the Shazam app, configuring it to use Spotify, and then opening the app every time to find a song - for it to go to Spotify. This mildly annoyed me because I know how easy it is to do this on Android. So I went out on a hunt for the easiest way to do this - Shortcuts 1. It turns out iOS has way…]]></description><link>https://www.dshomoye.dev/ios-shortcuts/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.dshomoye.dev/ios-shortcuts/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Testing the waters - Thoughts on Rust.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Rust holds the crown for “most-loved” language (5 years in a row) according to the stack overflow survey - quite an impressive feat. I actually didn’t know Rust was this beloved until I started writing this post and checked its position. I however have been wanting to foray into development with WebAssembly (wasm) for some time. Rust probably has the largest ecosystem for building with WebAssembly. And best suited for wasm over languages like Java or C# (or even GoLang) since they all have…]]></description><link>https://www.dshomoye.dev/trying-rust-lang/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.dshomoye.dev/trying-rust-lang/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Learning Observables the hard (easy) way]]></title><description><![CDATA[Observables (ReactiveX/Observer pattern) seem to be showing up everywhere I look. Or maybe I have just been looking for it. Either way. I’ve felt like I needed to learn to use them. Even though I haven’t had a problem requiring Observables. Well, I guess not even really knowing how it worked meant I had no idea when I should opt for it. So I did the next best thing: I shoe-horned it into a problem I had. And now that I’m through with it, I have a grasp of observables enough that I wanted to…]]></description><link>https://www.dshomoye.dev/observables-hard-easy/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.dshomoye.dev/observables-hard-easy/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Web Push Notifications in Gatsby.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Push notifications are an awesome addition to the web (when they’re not abused). It lets web apps send notifications to devices as if they’re natively installed apps! Gatsby on the other hand has turned building static sites into a pretty impressive ecosystem. Bringing push notifications into Gatsby is a natural next step for any modern site. You probably already know all this, if you’re here reading this and just want to know how, so I’ll jump right into it.

All because Google was tracking his every single step. This is why everyone should care. This could be anyone.

I just got excited after watching the show and decided to write about it. I haven’t really given Apple TV + a chance since it came out. I find it hard to start new shows. Something about committing to watching all the episodes just sends me down a spiral of despair. Yeah sure, I don’t have to keep watching if I don’t like it but then I never get closure, and all the time I spent “evaluating” is a waste.

I’m keeping it this way for… let’s say posterity. I have moved the actual posts (.md files) into a private repo and added that as a git submodule in the public repo. I’ve always felt like I needed a better way to separate the “content” from the “app”. I looked up “private git submodule” and the first answer is from a blogger who had literally the same idea  - shout out to them.

I will certainly try to be as cohesive as possible.
So as the title suggests, I want to question the role that social media plays in the current hyper-connected⧉ society. Now I should preface this by saying that I don’t hate social media. I am all for connecting with people, I love people! All of the peoples. That being said, I do have an issue with the way tech companies have essentially forced us to…]]></description><link>https://www.dshomoye.dev/no-social-media-no-life/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.dshomoye.dev/no-social-media-no-life/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Road trip to the South.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Heading south, down south. This was a notable trip for me, I’d never gone any farther south than Virginia, which is where I live now. Of course, VA itself is in the south, the capital of it too, at some point. But I live close enough to Washington, D.C. that I don’t consider myself living in the south. I haven’t particularly yearned for an opportunity to travel down south. This is mainly because I prefer, and I’m used to the more vibrant, busy, noisy (and quite frankly, straight-up crazy) life…]]></description><link>https://www.dshomoye.dev/trip-to-the-south/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.dshomoye.dev/trip-to-the-south/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Taking a ride to the wild west]]></title><description><![CDATA[Union Station This wasn’t really my first time on the west coast. It’s actually the third. First, I came to Las Vegas in the summer of 2018, for about a week. I luckily got to stay for free thanks to one of my good friends who had a month-long training there.
Then in November of 2018, I went to San Francisco, that trip ended up being more of a nature trip than a city one, even though I was in the bay area.

I really want to have a channel for narrating my thoughts, experiences and anything that I find interesting enough to write about, and since I have dedicated to the no-Facebook life, I have very limited options left. Perhaps, this is the only option, considering the amount of freedom I wish to have. So here it is.
Which reminds me, I should have post(s) on my experience living in 2020 without any (Facebook powered) social media. So lookout for that.
