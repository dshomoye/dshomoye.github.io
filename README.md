This is _usually_ running the`gatsby` branch but I'm currently building and deploying from local so sometimes the github branch lags by a few commits when I haven't pushed.

## local set up

you must have `gatsby-cli` installed to run the repo sripts
run `npm install -g gatsby-cl` then `npm install`

`npm run develop` to start a dev server.

everything is, _for the most part_ laid out like a standard gatsby repo
