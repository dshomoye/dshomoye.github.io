title: About Adedamola Shomoye
---

I am a software engineer currently based in New York.I primarily focus on server/backend development Django and NodeJS but also work on front end frameworks like ReactJS. I have done some work in mobile development in both iOS and Android. I have over 4 years of professional experience in Information Technology; Server and Network management and desktop engineering. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. I like listening to music, games, and travelling. My favorite game is most definitely Battlefield 4, for now at least and I would talk to my everyone in Python if I could, `it's simply a perfect language` (in my humble opinion).
You can check my github profile here to see some of the work I've done.
Feel free to add me on LinkedIn and Twitter as well.
Thanks for passing by!
